npm run test ========> jasmine script
npm run start========> express server start
npm run build========> build the code into js

the working urls is at  http://localhost:3000 and http://localhost:3000/api/images

i did a function that would return the already processed image and logged the process in the console i couldnt display the message in the server but again the user dont have to know its cached 

u should write filename beside width and height 
any lacking parameters the project wont work properly
